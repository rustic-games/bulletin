# 📍Bulletin

Templated Pinboard posts.

---

Bulletin is a small utility that allows you to convert a set of Pinboard posts
to a pre-defined template. It can be used to generate a self-hosted Pinboard
HTML page.

## Usage

```shell
cargo run -- --token ... -f "tag1,tag2" template.html > output.html
```

see `cargo run -- --help` for more details.
